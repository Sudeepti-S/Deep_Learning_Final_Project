# SYS 6016 : Final Report A Review and Comparison of CNN Architectures and Classifiers for Pneumonia Detection In X-Ray Images 

In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, it is evident that one of the fastest-growing AI applications is medicine. We will need to build robust prognostic models and help health professionals diagnose diseases from image data including x-ray images and biopsies and to improve the clinical decision-making process. Having said that, we wanted to further explore our study of CNNs especially within the domain of medicine and diagnosis. With this project, our goal is to experiment, evaluate and compare the accuracies of different models (varying architectures, pre-trained vs. non-pre-trained models) in addition to implementing different regularization techniques and fine tuning approaches. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of our project file up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


Required Data/Code: 

1. Our dataset is from Kaggle, uploaded two years ago with a set of 5,863 chest X-ray images. 
The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). 
There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). This dataset is required for the all the jupyter notebooks within this repository
